# Autism Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸ§ 

## Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning models to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using behavioral attributes. Comparing the performance of various classifiers, the project aims to provide accurate autism screening predictions to assist healthcare professionals.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost Classifier

## Dataset
The project uses the Autism Screening Adult Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, consisting of:
- 704 instances
- 21 attributes including:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Ethnicity
  - Jaundice
  - Family history of autism
  - 10 behavioral features (A1-A10)
  - Screening score

## Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Multiple model implementation and comparison
- Performance evaluation using various metrics
- Cross-validation for robust results
